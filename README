Titanium Utils
==============

This is a collection of JavaScript libs that are useful when developing titanium mobile applications.


Files
-----

lib/util.js - some methods taken from jQuery with others added

lib/factory.js - make using Ti.UI a little easier

lib/loader.js - loads the above libs and creates instances of them.


Patches
-------
Patches will be accepted if they do not change existing behaviour,
ideally people will overload custom settings (e.g. color method)
rather than changing the core libs.

YourPackage.prototype = new TuFox();

Todo
----
Move everything into a Tu. namespace
